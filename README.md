1. Do whatever you want with the original work, just don't be emotionally damaged.
Being emotionally damaged includes - but is not limited to:
	- Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this. I'm pretty sure your parents are already disappointed.
	- Selling this work without doing any modifications - That would probably make your parents happy... but that's being way too emotionally damaged.
	- Modifying the work to contain harmful material - Stop it... get some help.
	- Not appreciating the original creator(s)'s work - Now that's ultra emotional damage.
	- Not crediting the original creator(s) - That will make you heavily emotionally damaged.
2. If you achieve any form of success by either using this work or anything else that's related, share the love. Only a highly drunk or a guy suffering from ultra emotional damage would ignore everyone and get lots of profit.
3. If you ever meet the original author by any chance, you owe them a thank you and a drink of their choice if you happen to use their work for profit.
4. This work does not come with any warranty. It is provided as is. Using somebody's stuff and then complaining when something goes wrong is being affected by ULTRA emotional damage. Get some help or do it yourself. If you fix it, then document it and/or open an issue or report to somebody who knows what they are doing.
5. Don't be disappointed if you are emotionally damaged. That's your parents' job.
